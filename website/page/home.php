<h4>24th May 2014</h4>
<p>
And another IITC update, IITC 0.16.12 and IITC Mobile 0.11.0 have just been released, to fix things after the most recent
update to the standard intel site.
</p>
<p>
Note that Niantich have trimmed down the data a bit more, removing things not used by the standard intel site. In particular,
we no longer know the resonator deployment distance, the portal address, and the portal description.
Due to this, the 'show-address' and 'draw-resonators' plugins are no longer available.
