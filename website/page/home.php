IITC 0.11.2 released. This has a minor fix relating to portal visibility at different zoom levels. We now have to 
match the standard intel site. This does, unfortunately, mean you need to zoom even closer to see unclaimed portals.
Also, an update to the scoreboard plugin has been released that should make it work again.
