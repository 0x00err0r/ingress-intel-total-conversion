ingress intel total conversion (IITC)
=====================================

Since the [breunigs](https://github.com/breunigs/ingress-intel-total-conversion) IITC branch was deleted,
I've created this one to continue some development.

I have no particular plans for new features at this time.

Documentation is currently non-existant. Please feel free to contibute in this area.


Downloads
---------

**IMPORTANT** You *MUST* uninstall the original plugin before installing this one, otherwise you'll have it installed twice.
