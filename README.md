ingress.com/intel total conversion
==================================

It’s annoying to extend the intel page with new features because the minified code makes it hard to grasp what’s going on. Also, one has to play catch up each time Ninantic put up a new version because all the variables might get new names.

So instead, here’s a userscript that starts from scratch. 


Install
-------

Currently only works in Firefox with [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Scriptish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/).

If one of these addons is installed, clicking this should work:


[**INSTALL**](https://raw.github.com/breunigs/ingress-intel-total-conversion/gh-pages/total-conversion-build.user.js)



Contributing
------------

Please do!

(Obviously, Resistance folks must send in complete patches while Enlightenment gals and guys may just open feature request ☺)


Hacking
-------

Execute `./build.js` to effectively concatenate `main.js` with all the files in `code/`. It generates the user script which may be installed into your browser.

`style.css` contains most styles required for the user-script. The extra ones can be found in `code/boot.js#window.setupStyles`. Only CSS rules that depend on config variables should be defined there.

`leaflet_google.js` contains some code to display Google Maps imagery with Leaflet, which is a slightly modified version [of this gist](https://gist.github.com/4504864). I tried to track down the original author, but failed.


My dev setup is like this:
- checked out git repository
- symlinked the user script to the version in the repo. It should work like this:
  ```sh
  cd ~/.mozilla/firefox/<YOUR FF PROFILE>/scriptish_scripts/ingress-intel-total-conversion@breunigs
  
  ln -s ~/<PATH TO REPO>/total-conversion-build.user.js ingress-intel-total-conversion@breunigs.user.js
  ```
- if you are working on styles or scripts that are normally served via HTTP, you can setup an HTTP server for the current directory at `http://0.0.0.0:8000` using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
- run `./autobuild.sh` to re-build the user script whenever you make changes
- Focus the location bar and hit enter instead of reloading. This way your browser doesn’t look for new versions of cached files.
